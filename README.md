# IPL Data Analysis Project
This repository contains the code and analysis of IPL (Indian Premier League) data using Apache Spark on Databricks. 
The project focuses on extracting insights from historical IPL match data, including team performances, toss outcomes, player performances, and more. 
The analysis was performed using Spark SQL, DataFrame API, and various visualization techniques.

# Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the performance of teams and players in the IPL by exploring various match-related statistics and factors influencing game outcomes. 
project covers multiple aspects such as:

Team performance: Analyzing team win rates, performance after winning the toss, and other key statistics.
Player performance: Evaluating the best-performing bowlers and batsmen across seasons.
Match analysis: Analyzing match data to identify patterns related to toss decisions, winning streaks, etc.
Visualization: Visualizing the results using Databricks notebooks for better insights and decision-making.

# Technologies Used
Apache Spark: For distributed data processing and analysis.
Databricks: For interactive data analysis and visualization.
SQL: For querying and analyzing IPL match data.
Python: For running analysis and interacting with Spark.
PySpark: For Spark integration in Python.

# Features
Data Cleaning: Preprocessing and cleaning the raw IPL data to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and ensure the consistency of the data.
Team Performance Analysis:
Total matches played, wins, losses, and win percentage.
Performance analysis of teams after winning the toss.
Player Performance Analysis:
Best-performing bowlers in powerplay and death overs.
Analysis of batsmen's average runs per ball and total runs.
Toss Impact Analysis: Examining the impact of winning the toss on match outcomes.
Regression and Statistical Analysis: Performing regression analysis to understand factors influencing match outcomes.
